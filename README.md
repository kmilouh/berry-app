# Brain Enhancing Region Radiological analYsis ![logo](doc/img/berry0_128.png)

The BERRY app uses a pretrained CNN classifier scheme for voxel-wise classification of enhancing brain tumours into P-CNS-lymphoma, glioblastoma or brain metastasis, from dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI data.

This is the code repository of the BERRY tumour classification pipeline described in the work *An accessible deep learning tool for voxel-wise classification of brain malignancies from perfusion MRI* by Raquel Perez-Lopez and colleagues from the Vall d'Hebron Institute of Oncology (VHIO), Barcelona, Spain. Manuscript currently under review.


BERRY will be freely accessible online soon at:  [berry-app.vhio.org](https://berry-app.vhio.org/)

## Requirements
### Python
- Python 3.8
- Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`
- Optionally, to handle compressed DICOMs: pydicom (2.1.2 tested), gdcm (2.8.9 tested)

### External
#### 3D Slicer 4.8.1

- [windows](https://slicer-packages.kitware.com/api/v1/file/60add7aeae4540bf6a89c0eb/download)

- [mac](https://slicer-packages.kitware.com/api/v1/file/60add78bae4540bf6a89c0c4/download)

- [linux](https://slicer-packages.kitware.com/api/v1/file/60add79eae4540bf6a89c0d6/download)

#### dcm2niix

- [dcm2niix](https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix)

### NOTE
- If used without graphical interface in Linux systems, xvfb-run is needed (`apt-get install xvfb-run`)

## Installation
Download or clone the app repo in a directory, e.g., /berry

Though not necessary, you may create a new python/conda environment:

`conda create --name berryapp python=3.8`

`conda activate berryapp`

Install python packages:

`pip install -r /berry/requirements.txt`

Optionally:

`pip install pydicom==2.1.2`

`pip install gdcm==2.8.9`

Download Slicer from above links into, e.g. /slicer

Download dcm2niix from above links into, e.g. /dcm2niix

In `settings.py`, place the path of the Slicer executable as: `SLICER_EXEC="/slicer/Slicer"`

In `settings.py`, place the path of the dcm2niix executable as: `DCM2NIIX="/dcm2niix/dcm2niix"`

## Usage
To run the pipeline, call the `run.py` file as such:
`python /berry/run.py --p_dsc /path_to_DSC_image --p_t1 /path_to_T1_image --p_output /desired_output_path`

Input DSC and T1wCE volumes may be in DICOM, Nifti or NRRD formats.
Segmentation mask files can be provided instead of the T1 volume.

See all the options in the docstring help of `run.py`.
